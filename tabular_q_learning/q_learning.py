    """ Computes state-action value function in tabular form.

    Args:
        get_learning_rate: Function of current episode number returns learning
            rate.
        get_epsilon: Function of current episode number returns explore rate.
        get_gamma: A function of current episode returns gamma, remember to set
            gamma to None if using this.
        max_episodes: Maximum number of episodes to run for.
        grid_cells: Tuple of ints where the ith value is the number of
            grid_cells for ith dimension of state.
        state_bounds: List of tuples where ith tuple contains the min and max
            value in that order of ith dimension.
        env: OpenAI gym environment.
        max_episode_length: Number of timesteps that counts as solving an
            episode, also acts as max episode timesteps.
        q_values: Precomputed q_values function for warm start.
        start_episode: What episode to start hyper-parameter schedulers at if
            warmstart.
        suppress_print: Boolean whether to suppress print statements about
            current episode or not.
        seed: Seed for random number generator.
        violation_terminal_val: Whether to use a terminal state with this value
            for the backup when a trajectory *ends with a violation*. This
            avoids the need of adding grid cells inside the failure set. Note
            that we are assuming that gym steps returning done==True correspond
            to violations of the constraints.
        use_sbe: Whether to use the Safety Bellman Equation backup from
            equation (7) in [ICRA19]. If false the standard sum of discounted
            rewards backup is used.
        save_freq: How often to save q_values and stats.

    Returns:
        A numpy tensor of shape (grid_cells + (env.action_space.n,)) that
        contains the q_values value function. For example in cartpole the
        dimensions are q_values[x][x_dot][theta][theta_dot][action].
